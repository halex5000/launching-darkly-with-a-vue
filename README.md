## Getting Started

### :gear: **Setup**

If you don't already have a LaunchDarkly account, sign up for a [free trial of LaunchDarkly](https://app.launchdarkly.com/signup) to explore creating Feature Flags and targeting users with changes. It's fast, easy, and there's no obligation to continue.



### :flags: **Creating flags**

Create the following feature flags within LaunchDarkly

* `login`
  
  - Create this flag as a `boolean` flag 
  - This feature flag will be used to enable the login UI that can be used to leverage targeting based on a user ID.

* `new-ui`
  - Create this flag as a `boolean` flag
  - This feature flag changes the view of the application out of the Osmo logo, introducing a new banner, image, and text.

### :zipper_mouth_face: **Secret time**

Get your LaunchDarkly Client-Side ID from the [LaunchDarkly console](https://app.launchdarkly.com/)

- :sunglasses:  Super cool way 
  -  `CMD+K` or `CTRL+K`, typing "copy" and selecting `Copy SDK key for the current environment` and selecting **"Client-side ID"** from the list.

  </details>

- :hand: Manual way 
  - You can find the Client-Side ID under `Account Settings > Projects > <Your Project Name>`
  - Click your project name
  - Click the `Client-side ID` for the key you want
    (This will add it to your clipboard for easy copy and paste.)

- **:warning: Potential gotcha**: 
  make sure you got the **"Client-side ID"** from the LaunchDarkly console and not one of the other keys! 

### **Step 4** :ship: with :flags:

   1. Get the code

      ```
   2. Setup the env

      ```shell
      # go into the directory you just created by pulling the code
      cd launching-darkly-with-a-vue
      
      # this will make the terminal wait for your client ID to be pasted 
      read client_id
      
      # paste your client ID into the terminal and hit enter
      
      # this will write your client ID to your .env file, which is ignored by the .gitignore
      echo "VITE_CLIENT_ID=$client_id" > .env

      npm install
      ```

## :champagne: Let's pop some flags :champagne:

:rocket: If you've set everything up, you should be ready to roll! :rocket:

From here, we can enable our new feature and observe how our application changes based on a new feature being rolled out. 

* `login`
  - Enable this feature
    - click here to see how
    - You should now have a login field
    - Enter any name you want here and you should see the screen update to tell you who you have logged in as.
    - We'll use this feature to allow for specific user targeting
  - :information_desk_person: you just popped your first flag and saw a nearly instantaneous change in the UI :boom: thanks to the combined power of the reactive nature of Vue and the LaunchDarkly's global super powered Flag Delivery Network (FDN)
* `new-ui`
  - Create a `targeting rule` for your user, for this feature flag.
    - click here to see how
  - Ensure you set the `Default Rule` to false to ensure that only users who are targeted receive feature changes.
    - click here to see how
  - You should now see the new UI for your user, but let's see what it looks like for another user
    - enter a new username and click login again
    - your LaunchDarkly logo should update because you no longer get served the new UI feature
